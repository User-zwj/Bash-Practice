grep root /etc/passwd
grep -n root /etc/passwd       #-n: show line number

[grep or/and/not](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/10/grep-or-and-not-operators/)
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators ‘|’ or ‘|&’. The output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe to the input of the next command. That is, each command reads the previous command’s output. 

grep -V
grep --version

grep ^root /etc/passwd        #lines starting with 'root'
grep :$ /etc/passwd           #lines ending in ':'
grep export ~/.bash_profile | grep '\<PATH'
			      #lines starting with 'export PATH'
grep -w root /etc/passwd      #find a string that is a separate word
