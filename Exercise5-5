1. Print a list of files in your scripts directory, ending in ".sh". Mind that you might have to unalias ls. Put the result in a temporary file.

ls scripts/*.sh > scripts/ex55-1

2. Make a list of files in /usr/bin that have the letter "a" as the second character. Put the result in a temporary file.

ls /usr/bin/?a* > scripts/ex55-2

3. Delete the first 3 lines of each temporary file.

sed '1,3d' ex55-1 > ex55-1-del
sed '1,3d' ex55-2 > ex55-2-del

4. Print to standard output only th elines containing the pattern "an".

sed -n '/an/p' ex55-1-del
sed -n '/an/p' ex55-2-del

5. Create a file holding sed commands to perform the previous two tasks. Add an extra command to this file that adds a string like "***This might have something to do with amn and man pages*** in the line preceding every occurence of the string "man". Check the results.

6. A long listing of the root directory, /, is used for input. Create a file holding sed commands that check for symbolic links and plain files. If a file is symbolic link, precede it with a line like "--This is a symlink--". If the file is a plain file, add a string on the same line, adding a comment like "<---this is a plain file".

7. Create a script that shows lines containing trailing white spaces from a file. This script should use a sed script and show sensible information to the user.
