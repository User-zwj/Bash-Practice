## Variables
shell variables are in uppercase characters by convention.
- Global variables     #available in all shells
     'env' or 'printenv': display environment variables
- Local variables      #only available in the current shell
     'set': display a list of all variables (including environment variables) and functions.

## Creating variables
Variables are case sensitive and capitalized by default.
Giving local variables a lowercase name is a convention. eg.
var="2"     #no spaces around the equal sign!!!
echo $var
var2="first"
echo $var2
unset var var2

## Exporting variables
Variables created above are only available to current shell.
In order to pass variables to a subshell, we need to *export* the using the export built-in command.
Variables that are exported are referred to as environment variables. eg.
export VARNAME="value"
!!!A subshell can change variables it inherited from the parent, but the changes made by the child don't affect the parent. eg.
name="zwj"
bash
echo $name
exit
export name
bash
echo $name
export name="zj"
echo $name
exit
echo $name

## Reserved variables
check page39 for Bourne shell reserved variables and bash reserved variables

## Special parameters
The shell treats several paraters specially. These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.
see scripts/positional.sh, then run
positional.sh one two three four five
positional.sh one two
check page43 for more eg

## Script recycling with variables
check page43-44 for egs


## Quoting characters
# Escape character 
    backslash \
    single quotes ' '
    double quotes " "
eg:
date=20000101
echo $date
echo \$date
echo '$date'
echo "$date"
echo "`date`"
echo "I'd say: \"Go for it!\""     #problem!!!
echo "\"
echo "\\"


## Shell expansion
1. Brace expansion
echo sp{el,il,al}l
2. Tilde expansion
***
3. Variable expansion
echo $SHELL
echo ${!N*}
echo $FRANKY
echo ${FRANKY:=Franky}
4. Command substitution
when a command is enclose like 
$(command)
or
`command`
eg.
echo `date`
echo $(date)
5. Arithmetic expansion
$((Expression))
Example:
a=1
b=3
echo $((a+b))
or
((c=a+b))
echo $c

a=3
echo $((++a/2))

y=$((++a/2)) means a=a+1,y=a/2
y=$((a++/2)) means y=a/2,a=a+1

6. Process subsitution
7. Word splitting


## Aliases
alias ..='cd ..'
  df: disk filesystem
alias dh='df -h'
dh
unalias dh
dh

## More Bash options
-o option to set to display all shell options: eg
set -o noclobber
set -u                 #treat unset variables as an error when set
set -o noglob          #prevent special characters from bing expanded
Example:
set -o noclobber      #set noclobber command prevents existing files from being overwritten
touch test
date > test
set +o noclobber     #disable using +
date > test

echo $VAR
set -u
echo $VAR

set -o noglob
touch *
ls -l *
