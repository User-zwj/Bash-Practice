1. Create 3 variables, VAR1, VAR2 and VAR3; initialize them to hold the values "thirteen", "13" and "Happy Birthday" respectively.
VAR1="thirteen"
VAR2="13"
VAR3="Happy Birthday"

2. Display the values of all three variables.
echo $VAR1
echo $VAR2
echo $VAR3

3. Are these local or global variables?
Local

4. Remove VAR3
unset VAR3

5. Can you see the two reamining variables in a new terminal window?
No. Because they are only defined locally.

6. Edit /etc/profile so that all users are greeted upon login (test this).
cd /etc/
sudo chmod 644 profile
sudo vim profile
    then in the file, you can something like
	echo "Hi, $User!"
    and save it
sudo chmod 444 profile

7. For the root account, set the prompt to something like "Danger!! root is doing stuff in \w", preferably in a bright color such as red or pink or in reverse video mode.

In ~/.bash_profile,
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi
In ~/.bashrc
# Highlight the user name when logged in as root.
if [[ "${USER}" == "root" ]]; then
	userStyle="${red}";
	PS1=“Danger!! root is doing stuff in \w”;
	export PS1;
else
	userStyle="${orange}";
fi;

(Not working!!!)

**To go to the sudo mode, use
sudo su
**To get out of the sudo mode, use
exit


8. Make sure that newly created users also get a nice personalized prompt which informs them on which system in which directory they are working. Test your changes by adding a new user and logging in as that user.

9. Write a script in which you assign two integer values to two variables. The script should calculate the surface of a rectangle which has these proportions. It should be aired with comments and generate elegant output.

Create file scripts/Exercise3-8-Q9.sh
then, run
chmod 744 Exercise3-8-Q9.sh
Exercise3-8-Q9.sh
