1. Display a list of all the users on your system who log in with the Bash shell as a default.

grep '/bin/bash' /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{ print $1}'
or 
grep '/bin/bash' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1

2. From the /etc/group directory, display all lines starting with the string "daemon".

grep ^daemon /etc/group

3. Print all the lines from the same file that don't contain the string.

grep -v ^daemon /etc/grup

4. Display localhost information from the /etc/hosts file, display the line number(s) matching the search string and count the number of occurrences of the string.

grep localhost /etc/hosts
grep -n localhost /etc/hosts
grep -c localhost /etc/hosts

5. Display a list of /usr/share/doc subdirectories containing information about shells.

grep shell /usr/share/doc/*/*

6. How many README files do these subdirectories contain? Don't count anything in the form of "README.a_string".

grep shell /usr/share/doc/*/* | grep -c README
(Something missing)

7. Make a list of files in your home directory that were changed less than 10 hours ago, using grep, but leave out directories.
